This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-03-28 20:03:00 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

## 2025-03-28 - Initial Architecture Documentation

### Decision

Based on the README and project structure, documenting the initial architecture decisions that have shaped the Timekeeper project.

### Rationale

Capturing the existing architectural decisions provides a foundation for future development and helps maintain consistency in the project's direction.

### Implementation Details

- **Mathematical Foundation First**: The project follows a "math-first" approach, where rigorous mathematical definitions precede implementation.
- **Quarto Documentation System**: Selected for its ability to integrate mathematical notation, code, and visualizations.
- **Python as Primary Implementation**: Initial development focuses on Python with clear paths for potential JS and R implementations.
- **Integration Scripts**: Dedicated scripts ensure consistency between mathematical concepts and code implementations.

## 2025-03-28 20:30:00 - Framework Roles and Integration Architecture

### Decision

Define clear roles for each framework component (Python, Quarto, Sphinx) and establish their integration strategy, along with a CI/CD pipeline specification.

### Rationale

Clear framework roles and integration points are needed to ensure coherent development and documentation. A well-defined CI/CD pipeline will automate testing, documentation generation, and deployment processes.

### Implementation Details

#### Framework Roles

1. **Python**

   - Primary implementation language for all computational components
   - Responsible for mathematical implementations with type hints
   - Powers the core temporal dynamics systems:
     - `AgentTemporal`: Base temporal system
     - `TaskScheduler`: Scheduling functionality
     - `AdaptiveAgentTemporal`: Dynamic adaptation mechanisms
     - Visualization components
   - All implementations must maintain mathematical rigor with LaTeX docstrings

2. **Quarto**

   - Documentation management system
   - Responsible for interactive documentation with mathematical notation
   - Organized hierarchically: concepts → components → examples
   - Features:
     - Interactive examples with executable code blocks
     - Mathematical notation with LaTeX
     - Visual diagrams for temporal relationships
     - Metadata system for content filtering

3. **Sphinx**

   - Documentation builds successfully

## 2025-03-28 20:35:00 - Comprehensive Architectural Documentation

### Decision

Create comprehensive architectural documentation that defines the system architecture, implementation strategy, and development roadmap.

### Rationale

To establish a clear technical foundation for the project and provide guidance for implementation, documentation integration, and CI/CD processes.

### Implementation Details

Three key architectural documents have been created:

1. **Architecture Specification** (`docs/architecture-specification.md`):

   - Defines the system components and their relationships
   - Specifies the mathematical foundations
   - Outlines technical implementation details
   - Establishes quality assurance standards
   - Provides deployment and operations guidance

2. **Sphinx-Quarto Integration Plan** (`docs/sphinx-quarto-integration-plan.md`):

   - Details the integration between Sphinx and Quarto
   - Provides configuration files and scripts
   - Outlines the documentation workflow
   - Specifies the CI/CD pipeline for documentation

3. **MVP Development Roadmap** (`docs/mvp-development-roadmap.md`):
   - Defines the MVP scope and features
   - Outlines development phases and deliverables
   - Provides technical implementation details
   - Establishes success criteria
   - Manages risks and resource requirements

## 2025-03-28 20:40:00 - Sphinx-Quarto Integration Implementation Plan

### Decision

Created a detailed implementation plan document for integrating Sphinx with Quarto for API documentation generation.

### Rationale

While the high-level integration strategy was already defined, a detailed implementation guide with specific file configurations, code modifications, and step-by-step instructions was needed to ensure successful implementation by the development team.

### Implementation Details

- Created `docs/sphinx-quarto-implementation-steps.md` with comprehensive guidance
- Specified Sphinx configuration settings needed for mathematical documentation
- Provided updated build script code to integrate Sphinx with the existing Quarto process
- Detailed directory structure changes and file configurations needed
- Set a clear timeline and success criteria for implementation
- Ensured compatibility with the existing docstring format and requirements

## 2025-03-28 21:30:00 - Sphinx-Quarto Integration Alignment with Updated Architecture

### Decision

Revised the Sphinx-Quarto integration strategy to align with the updated architecture specification, emphasizing the research-oriented approach with mathematical theory foundation.

### Rationale

The updated architecture specification presents a significantly different structure focused on maintaining bidirectional traceability between mathematical theory and implementation. The previous integration plan needed to be redesigned to fit within this new architectural paradigm.

### Implementation Details

- Restructured the documentation directory to align with theory/implementation/research divisions
- Moved configuration files to a dedicated config/ directory with separate sphinx/ and quarto/ subdirectories
- Updated build scripts to handle theory documentation, API documentation, and research documentation separately
- Enhanced docstring formats to include explicit references to mathematical definitions
- Implemented cross-referencing between theory documents and implementation
- Created a layered build system that coordinates the generation of all documentation components

## 2025-03-28 21:57:00 - Documentation Reorganization Plan

### Decision

Created a comprehensive documentation reorganization plan to address scattered documentation issues and align with the research-oriented architecture.

### Rationale

The current documentation structure is inconsistent with the updated architecture specification and has issues with scattered, redundant, and outdated content. A clear organization plan is needed to ensure all documentation follows the research-oriented architecture and maintains bidirectional traceability between theory and implementation.

### Implementation Details

- Designed a new directory structure that follows the research-oriented approach:
  - Clear separation between theory, implementation, research, and reference documentation
  - Dedicated locations for architecture documents, developer guides, and examples
  - Consolidated location for migration and integration plans
- Created a detailed document mapping table to track the movement of all documents
- Outlined a phased implementation plan with clear success criteria
- Documented the plan in `docs/documentation-organization-plan.md`

## 2025-03-28 22:32:00 - Documentation Reorganization Completion

### Decision

Completed the comprehensive documentation reorganization according to the research-oriented architecture plan.

### Rationale

The documentation reorganization was necessary to establish a clear, structured approach to documentation that aligns with the research-oriented architecture of the Timekeeper project, ensuring bidirectional traceability between mathematical theory and implementation.

### Implementation Details

- **Created New Directory Structure**:

  - Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture/`)
  - Reference materials (`docs/reference/` with subdirectories for integration plans, migration guides, notes, and role definitions)
  - Theory documentation placeholders (`docs/theory/`)
  - Implementation documentation placeholders (`docs/implementation/`)
  - Research framework placeholder (`docs/research/`)

- **Consolidated Documentation**:

  - Combined architecture specifications into `system-overview.md`
  - Combined roadmap documents into `development-roadmap.md`
  - Consolidated Sphinx-Quarto integration documentation

- **Moved Existing Files**:

  - Moved role definitions to reference section
  - Moved notes to reference section
  - Moved integration guide to dev-guides

- **Created Placeholders**:

  - Theory documents for core mathematical concepts
  - Implementation documents for key components
  - Research framework overview
  - API documentation placeholder

## 2025-03-28 22:36:00 - MVP Completion Strategy
