[2025-03-28 23:08:00] - Current focus is on implementing an enhanced GitHub CI/CD workflow for the project. The workflow has been designed and documented in memory-bank/enhanced-ci-workflow.md, with the next step being implementation of the workflow file in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

[2025-03-28 23:12:45] - Completed implementation of GitHub CI/CD workflow and created documentation about required GitHub setup including permissions, secrets (PYPI_API_TOKEN), Codecov integration, and branch protection rules. This information is captured in .github/GITHUB_SETUP.md to guide GitHub repository configuration.

[2025-03-28 23:36:00] - Enhanced the Makefile to support local testing that matches the CI/CD workflow. Added targets for security scanning, Sphinx documentation building, combined documentation, and release validation. Added a comprehensive 'check-all' target that runs all checks locally in the same way the CI pipeline does. Updated GitHub documentation to reference these Makefile targets.

[2025-03-28 23:43:30] - Set up local token management for CI/CD integration. Created ~/.secrets/timekeeper/tokens.env file with proper permissions for storing PYPI_API_TOKEN and CODECOV_TOKEN. Created scripts/setup_env_tokens.sh script for automating token setup. Updated Makefile with check-env target and integrated environment variable loading into relevant targets (coverage, validate-release).

[2025-03-29 12:41:00] - Current focus is on Phase 2 implementation of the Timekeeper project. We've created a comprehensive implementation plan (memory-bank/phase2-implementation-plan.md) that outlines the specific tasks needed to complete Phase 2, prioritizing integration tests, docstring enhancement, and example suite development. We've also developed a documentation deduplication strategy (memory-bank/documentation-deduplication-strategy.md) to ensure information is well-organized without redundancy across different documentation types.
