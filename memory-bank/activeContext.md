- How should we handle the transition from the previous Sphinx-Quarto implementation to the new research-oriented architecture?

## 2025-03-28 22:33:30 - Documentation Reorganization Project

### Current Focus

The project has completed a major documentation reorganization to align with the research-oriented architecture. The focus is now on converting Quarto (.qmd) files to Markdown (.md) files and filling in the placeholder documentation with actual content.

### Recent Changes

- Created a new documentation structure with clear separation between theory, implementation, and research
- Organized reference materials into subdirectories (integration plans, migration guides, notes, role definitions)
- Created placeholder files for all major theoretical concepts and implementation components
- Moved and consolidated existing documentation according to the new structure
- Removed obsolete or redundant documentation files

### Open Questions/Issues

- Should we maintain both .qmd and .md versions of theory documentation, or standardize on one format?
- What specific visualization formats should be used for theoretical concepts?
- Are there any missing documentation categories in the current structure?
- How should we handle versioned documentation as the project evolves?
- What is the priority order for filling in the placeholder documentation?

## 2025-03-28 22:36:30 - MVP Completion Phase

### Current Focus

The project is entering the MVP Completion Phase. The core implementation components (AgentTemporal, TaskScheduler, AdaptiveAgentTemporal, Visualization) are all completed. The focus now shifts to integration, documentation, and usability improvements to create a releasable MVP.

### Recent Changes

- Completed review of all core implementation components
- Identified that all core implementation features are completed
- Established a comprehensive MVP Completion Strategy
- Reorganized documentation to support the research-oriented architecture

### Open Questions/Issues

- How should we prioritize the MVP Completion Strategy tasks?
- What specific examples would best demonstrate the framework's capabilities?
- What level of test coverage should we target before the MVP release?
- How can we best demonstrate the mathematical foundations in the code and documentation?
- What metrics should we use to evaluate the performance of the system?

## 2025-03-28 22:53:00 - Documentation Completion Progress

### Current Focus

We have completed the theoretical foundation documentation and implementation guides for the Timekeeper MVP. The current focus is on preparing the project for implementation of the remaining MVP tasks: integration testing, docstring enhancement, and example development.

### Recent Changes

- Completed all theory documentation files with bidirectional traceability to implementation
- Created theory documentation index page
- Created implementation documentation index page
- Developed detailed integration test examples
- Created docstring enhancement guide with LaTeX templates
- Developed complete workflow example
- Created MVP completion roadmap

### Open Questions/Issues

- Which integration tests should be prioritized for first implementation?
- Should we standardize on .md files, .qmd files, or both for documentation?
- What is the best approach to enhance docstrings while maintaining readability?
- How can we best demonstrate the mathematical rigor of the framework in the documentation?
- Should additional examples be developed for specific use cases?

## 2025-03-28 22:58:00 - Implementation Plans Completed

### Current Focus

We have completed detailed implementation plans for both the Time Flow Verification tests and the AgentTemporal docstring enhancement. These plans provide step-by-step guidance to implement the highest priority MVP tasks.

### Recent Changes

- Created comprehensive Time Flow Verification test implementation plan with test code examples
- Developed detailed AgentTemporal docstring enhancement plan with LaTeX formulas
- Created implementation templates for all key test components (basic operations, mathematical properties, etc.)
- Provided enhanced docstring templates for all AgentTemporal methods with bidirectional traceability

### Open Questions/Issues

- What is the optimal sequence for implementing the remaining test categories?
- How should we handle visual validation of LaTeX formulas in the documentation?
- Should we implement a CI workflow for automated testing of the mathematical properties?
- How should we coordinate between the theory documentation and implementation docstrings?
- What approach should we take for visualizing complex temporal structures?

[2025-03-28 23:08:00] - Current focus is on implementing an enhanced GitHub CI/CD workflow for the project. The workflow has been designed and documented in memory-bank/enhanced-ci-workflow.md, with the next step being implementation of the workflow file in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

[2025-03-28 23:12:45] - Completed implementation of GitHub CI/CD workflow and created documentation about required GitHub setup including permissions, secrets (PYPI_API_TOKEN), Codecov integration, and branch protection rules. This information is captured in .github/GITHUB_SETUP.md to guide GitHub repository configuration.

[2025-03-28 23:36:00] - Enhanced the Makefile to support local testing that matches the CI/CD workflow. Added targets for security scanning, Sphinx documentation building, combined documentation, and release validation. Added a comprehensive 'check-all' target that runs all checks locally in the same way the CI pipeline does. Updated GitHub documentation to reference these Makefile targets.

[2025-03-28 23:43:30] - Set up local token management for CI/CD integration. Created ~/.secrets/timekeeper/tokens.env file with proper permissions for storing PYPI_API_TOKEN and CODECOV_TOKEN. Created scripts/setup_env_tokens.sh script for automating token setup. Updated Makefile with check-env target and integrated environment variable loading into relevant targets (coverage, validate-release).

- Are there any upcoming features or research directions that should be prioritized?
