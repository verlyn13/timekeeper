# Product Context

This file provides a high-level overview of the project and the expected product that will be created. Initially it is based upon projectBrief.md (if provided) and all other available project-related information in the working directory. This file is intended to be updated as the project evolves, and should be used to inform all other modes of the project's goals and context.

## Project Goal

Timekeeper is a comprehensive framework for optimizing temporal dynamics in small-scale agent systems. It aims to provide a mathematically rigorous approach to handling time in agent systems, with implementations in Python and potentially other languages in the future.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Temporal Partitioning**: Organize time into nested uniform partitions
- **Timepoint Operations**: Well-defined addition, subtraction, and comparison
- **Human-Agent Time Mapping**: Bidirectional morphisms between agent time and human time
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Automatic adjustment of temporal granularity
- **Task Scheduling**: Optimized scheduling for small-scale agent systems
- **Interactive Documentation**: Quarto-based documentation system with integrated code execution
- **Research Framework**: Structured approach to hypothesis tracking and experimental design

## Overall Architecture

The Timekeeper project is structured around several key components:

1. **Mathematical Foundation**: Rigorous mathematical definitions of temporal hierarchies, operations, and properties
2. **Python Implementation**: Clean, well-documented code that directly implements the mathematical constructs
3. **Documentation System**: Quarto-based documentation with interactive examples and visualizations
4. **Integration Layer**: Scripts and workflows that ensure consistency between theory and implementation
5. **Research Components**: Hypotheses tracking and experimental design framework

## 2025-03-28 22:34:00 - Documentation Structure Completion

The Timekeeper project has completed a comprehensive documentation reorganization that aligns with the research-oriented architecture. This marks a significant milestone in establishing the project's core structure and approach to knowledge management.

The documentation now follows a clear organization that separates theory (mathematical foundations), implementation (code), research (hypotheses and experiments), architecture (system design), and reference materials. This structure supports the project's goals by:

1. **Enforcing Bidirectional Traceability**: Ensuring clear mapping between mathematical concepts and their implementation
2. **Supporting Research Focus**: Providing dedicated space for research hypotheses, experiments, and results
3. **Enabling Incremental Development**: Allowing placeholder documentation to be filled in as the project progresses
4. **Improving Discoverability**: Making it easier for new contributors to understand the project through clear documentation paths

This reorganization has also helped clarify the project's scope and boundaries by making explicit which components are core to the Timekeeper framework and which are supporting materials or future extensions.

## [2025-03-30 11:44:00] - Development Environment Enhancement

Vertex AI Workbench has been adopted as the primary managed environment for interactive development and research tasks. This leverages GCP's scalable infrastructure and integrates seamlessly with other Vertex AI services and the project's established authentication patterns. (Ref: `docs/implementation/vertex-ai-workbench-integration-plan.md`)
The project follows a consistent development workflow designed to maintain the alignment between mathematical theory and code implementation, with docstrings referencing mathematical concepts and Quarto documents providing explanations and demonstrations.
