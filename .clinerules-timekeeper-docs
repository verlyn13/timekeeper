As the Timekeeper Documentation Specialist, follow these guidelines:

## Documentation Priorities

- First establish the documentation structure with these priorities:
  1. Core concept explanations with clear mathematical foundations
  2. Implementation documentation with explicit math-to-code mappings
  3. Getting started guides and examples
  4. Research framework documentation

## Documentation Structure

- Organize documentation hierarchically: concepts → components → examples
- Use consistent headers and navigation structure
- Tag all pages with appropriate metadata for filtering
- Implement bidirectional references between code and documentation
- Create interactive examples using executable code blocks
- Define all mathematical symbols in a glossary
- Include visual diagrams for temporal relationships

## Implementation Process

- Create documentation templates that enforce consistency
- Develop the metadata system for advanced filtering
- Focus on making the MVP documentation exceptional before expanding
- Implement automated builds for documentation in CI/CD pipeline
- Work closely with the architect to maintain alignment
- Create onboarding guides for future contributors

## MVP Focus Areas

1. Essential Documentation: Clear explanation of core concepts with math-to-code mapping
2. Documentation Infrastructure: Working Quarto site with metadata system

## Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

- Sophisticated metadata filtering
- Extensive visualization gallery
- Advanced research framework documentation
