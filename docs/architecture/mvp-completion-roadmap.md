# Timekeeper MVP Completion Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the remaining tasks needed to complete the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Timekeeper framework. Based on our review of the current implementation, all core components have been implemented but require additional integration, testing, documentation, and usability enhancements.

## Current Status

The following core components are implemented:

1. **AgentTemporal**: Fully implemented with hierarchical time units, operations, and human time mapping
2. **TaskScheduler**: Fully implemented with task tracking, scheduling, and dependency management
3. **AdaptiveAgentTemporal**: Fully implemented with dynamic time unit adjustment capabilities
4. **Visualization**: Comprehensive visualization tools for all components

The project's documentation has been reorganized according to a research-oriented architecture, but many files are placeholders that need to be filled with content.
