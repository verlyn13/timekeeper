# Lattice Structure

> **Note**: This is a placeholder document that needs to be filled with content converted from `docs/theory/lattice_structure.qmd`.

## Overview

The Lattice Structure concept provides a mathematical framework for understanding the relationships between different temporal partitions, enabling formalization of refinement, coarsening, and operations on temporal hierarchies.

## Mathematical Definition

_This section should contain the formal mathematical definition of the lattice structure of partitions, including reference to Definition 21 in the formal theory._

## Lattice Operations

### Join

_Definition and properties of the join operation on partitions_

### Meet

_Definition and properties of the meet operation on partitions_

## Properties

_This section should outline the key properties of the partition lattice, including any axioms or theorems that apply._

## Refinement and Coarsening

_This section should explain the concepts of refinement and coarsening of partitions and how they relate to the lattice structure._

## Implementation Reference

This concept is implemented in the `src.core.lattice.partition_lattice` module.

## Examples

_This section should provide examples of how the lattice structure is used in practice, both mathematically and in the implementation._
