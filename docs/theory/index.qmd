# Timekeeper: Theoretical Foundation

This section provides the mathematical foundation of the Timekeeper project. The framework is built on a rigorous mathematical theory of temporal structures, operations, and morphisms.

## Core Concepts

- [Temporal Universe](temporal_universe.qmd): Definition 1
- [Hierarchical Partition](hierarchical_partition.qmd): Definition 2
- [Timepoint Operations](timepoint_operations.qmd): Definitions 6-8
- [Temporal Morphisms](morphisms.qmd): Definitions 16-19
- [Lattice Structure](lattice_structure.qmd): Definition 21

## Mathematical Properties

The theory establishes several key properties that underpin the implementation:

- [Temporal Coordination Efficiency](../research/hypotheses/coordination_efficiency.qmd)
- [Agent-Specific Temporal Density](../research/hypotheses/temporal_density.qmd)
- [Scheduler Optimization](../research/hypotheses/scheduler_optimization.qmd)

## Formal Theory

The complete formal mathematical theory is available in LaTeX format in the `theory/formal/` directory:

- `definitions.tex`: Formal definitions of temporal concepts
- `axioms.tex`: Axioms governing temporal operations
- `theorems.tex`: Theorems derived from the definitions and axioms
- `full_theory.tex`: Complete formal theory document

## Theory-Implementation Mapping

Each theoretical construct has a corresponding implementation in the codebase. The mapping between theory and implementation is documented in the `theory/mappings/` directory:

- `definition_map.yaml`: Maps formal definitions to code entities
- `axiom_map.yaml`: Maps axioms to implementation rules
- `theorem_map.yaml`: Maps theorems to algorithms and validations

## Visualizations

Visualizations of the theoretical concepts can be found in the [API Reference](../implementation/api/index.html) and the [Visualization Gallery](../examples/visualization-gallery.qmd).
