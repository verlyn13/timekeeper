# Task Scheduler

> **Note**: This is a placeholder document that needs to be filled with detailed implementation information.

## Overview

The Task Scheduler is a component of the Timekeeper framework that manages the scheduling of tasks with temporal constraints and dependencies, optimizing schedules based on mathematical principles established in the theory.

## Mathematical Foundation

This implementation is based on the following theoretical concepts:

- [Temporal Universe](../theory/temporal_universe.md) and operations
- [Timepoint Operations](../theory/timepoint_operations.md) for handling temporal constraints
- Scheduling theory and optimization algorithms

## Implementation Details

### Class Structure

```python
class Task:
    """Representation of a schedulable unit of work."""

    def __init__(self, id: str, duration: TimeInterval, earliest_start: Optional[TimePoint] = None,
                 latest_end: Optional[TimePoint] = None):
        """Initialize a task with temporal constraints."""

class TaskDependency:
    """Representation of a dependency between tasks."""

    def __init__(self, source_task: Task, target_task: Task,
                 dependency_type: DependencyType, offset: Optional[TimeInterval] = None):
        """Initialize a task dependency."""

class ScheduleConstraint:
    """Temporal constraint on scheduling."""

    def __init__(self, constraint_type: ConstraintType, task: Task, value: Any):
        """Initialize a schedule constraint."""

class TaskScheduler:
    """Main interface for task scheduling."""

    def __init__(self, temporal_system: AgentTemporal):
        """Initialize with a temporal system."""

    def add_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        """Add a task to be scheduled."""

    def add_dependency(self, dependency: TaskDependency) -> None:
        """Add a dependency between tasks."""

    def add_constraint(self, constraint: ScheduleConstraint) -> None:
        """Add a temporal constraint on scheduling."""

    def generate_schedule(self) -> Schedule:
        """Generate an optimized schedule based on tasks, dependencies, and constraints."""

    def is_feasible(self) -> bool:
        """Check if a feasible schedule exists."""
```

### Key Features

- Support for various types of temporal constraints
- Dependency management with cycle detection
- Multiple scheduling algorithms for different use cases
- Optimization for small-scale agent systems (1-3 agents)

## Testing

Integration tests for the Task Scheduler are implemented in `tests/integration/test_task_scheduler_integration.py`. These tests verify the correct interaction between the `TaskScheduler` and the core temporal systems (`AgentTemporal` and `AdaptiveAgentTemporal`), including:

- Basic scheduling and temporal ordering.
- Handling of task dependencies.
- Multi-agent scheduling scenarios.
- Scheduling behavior after temporal adaptation.
- Preservation of temporal ordering properties (using Hypothesis).

## Usage Examples

_This section should include code examples showing how to use the TaskScheduler class for common scenarios._

## Performance Considerations

_This section should discuss performance characteristics, optimization strategies for different scheduling algorithms, and benchmarks._
