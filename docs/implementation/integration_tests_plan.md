# Integration Tests Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the integration test suite for the Timekeeper framework MVP. The goal is to create a comprehensive set of tests that verify the correct interaction between the key components:

1. `AgentTemporal`
2. `TaskScheduler`
3. `AdaptiveAgentTemporal`
4. Visualization components

## Integration Test Strategy

The integration tests will focus on realistic workflows that span multiple components, verifying that they work together correctly and maintain mathematical consistency throughout the process.

### Key Testing Principles

- **End-to-End Workflows**: Test complete workflows from temporal system creation to scheduling and visualization
- **Mathematical Verification**: Verify that operations maintain the mathematical properties defined in the theoretical framework
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test boundary conditions and unusual configurations
- **Property-Based Testing**: Use property-based testing to verify mathematical invariants

## Test Categories

### 1. Time Flow Verification

Tests that verify the correct flow of time through various operations and components.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Basic Time Flow**

   - Create timepoints in `AgentTemporal`
   - Perform operations (add, subtract, compare)
   - Verify results maintain mathematical properties

2. **Adaptive Time Adjustments**

   - Create an `AdaptiveAgentTemporal` instance
   - Perform operations that trigger adaptation
   - Verify adaptation occurs correctly
   - Verify time consistency before and after adaptation

3. **Time Morphism Testing**
   - Convert between agent time and human time
   - Verify bidirectional consistency
   - Test edge cases (e.g., very large time values)

### 2. Task Scheduling Integration

Tests that verify the integration between temporal systems and scheduling.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Basic Scheduling**

   - Create temporal system
   - Define tasks with dependencies
   - Schedule tasks
   - Verify schedule correctness (dependencies respected, no overlaps)

2. **Adaptive Scheduling**

   - Create adaptive temporal system
   - Define and schedule tasks
   - Trigger time unit adaptation
   - Verify schedule remains consistent after adaptation

3. **Multi-Agent Scheduling**
   - Create temporal system with multiple agents
   - Schedule tasks across agents
   - Verify load balancing and dependency satisfaction

### 3. Visualization Integration

Tests that verify the integration between temporal systems and visualization.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Timepoint Visualization**

   - Create temporal system and timepoints
   - Generate visualizations
   - Verify visualization correctness

2. **Schedule Visualization**

   - Create temporal system and schedule tasks
   - Visualize the schedule
   - Verify visualization correctly represents the schedule

3. **Conversion Visualization**
   - Create temporal system with custom units
   - Visualize conversion factors
   - Verify visualization correctly represents conversions

### 4. End-to-End Workflow Tests

Tests that verify complete workflows through all components.

#### Test Cases:

1. **Complete Workflow: Basic**

   - Create temporal system
   - Define and schedule tasks
   - Generate visualizations
   - Verify all components work together

2. **Complete Workflow: Adaptation**

   - Create adaptive temporal system
   - Define and schedule tasks
   - Trigger adaptation
   - Generate visualizations before and after adaptation
   - Verify consistency throughout the workflow

3. **Complete Workflow: Time Conversion**
   - Create temporal system
   - Convert between agent and human time
   - Schedule tasks using both time systems
   - Visualize results
   - Verify consistency

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure

```python
def test_basic_workflow():
    # 1. Create temporal system
    agent_temporal = AgentTemporal()

    # 2. Create timepoints
    t1 = agent_temporal.create_timepoint(epoch=1, cycle=10)
    t2 = agent_temporal.create_timepoint(cycle=50)

    # 3. Perform operations
    t3 = agent_temporal.add_time(t1, cycle=5)

    # 4. Create scheduler
    scheduler = TaskScheduler(agent_temporal)

    # 5. Add tasks
    scheduler.add_task("T1", {"step": 100})
    scheduler.add_task("T2", {"cycle": 2}, ["T1"])

    # 6. Schedule tasks
    scheduled_tasks = scheduler.schedule()

    # 7. Verify schedule
    assert len(scheduled_tasks) == 2
    assert scheduled_tasks[0]["id"] == "T1"
    assert scheduled_tasks[1]["id"] == "T2"

    # 8. Create visualizations
    viz_data = scheduler.visualize_schedule()

    # 9. Verify visualization data
    assert len(viz_data) == 2
    assert viz_data[0]["id"] == "T1"
    assert viz_data[1]["id"] == "T2"
```

### Property-Based Tests

For mathematical properties, we'll use hypothesis to define property-based tests:

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

# Define custom strategies for timepoints
@st.composite
def timepoint_strategy(draw):
    epoch = draw(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=10))
    cycle = draw(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=59))
    step = draw(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=999))
    return {"epoch": epoch, "cycle": cycle, "step": step}

# Test associativity of timepoint addition
@given(tp1=timepoint_strategy(), tp2=timepoint_strategy(), tp3=timepoint_strategy())
def test_addition_associativity(tp1, tp2, tp3):
    agent_temporal = AgentTemporal()

    # (a + b) + c
    ab = agent_temporal.add_time(tp1, **tp2)
    result1 = agent_temporal.add_time(ab, **tp3)

    # a + (b + c)
    bc = agent_temporal.add_time(tp2, **tp3)
    result2 = agent_temporal.add_time(tp1, **bc)

    # Verify associativity
    assert agent_temporal.compare_timepoints(result1, result2) == 0
```

## Performance Tests

In addition to correctness tests, we'll include performance benchmarks:

```python
import pytest
import time

def test_scheduling_performance():
    agent_temporal = AgentTemporal()
    scheduler = TaskScheduler(agent_temporal)

    # Add many tasks with dependencies
    for i in range(100):
        deps = [f"T{i-1}"] if i > 0 else []
        scheduler.add_task(f"T{i}", {"step": 10}, deps)

    # Measure scheduling time
    start = time.time()
    scheduled_tasks = scheduler.schedule()
    end = time.time()

    # Verify performance is within acceptable range
    assert end - start < 1.0  # Should schedule 100 tasks in under 1 second
```
