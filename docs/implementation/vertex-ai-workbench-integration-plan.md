# Vertex AI Workbench Integration Plan

**Date:** 2025-03-30

**Status:** Proposed

**Objective:** Integrate Google Cloud Vertex AI Workbench into the Timekeeper project workflow as a primary environment for interactive research, development, testing, and documentation tasks, ensuring alignment with existing architectural patterns, security practices, and documentation standards.

---

## Prerequisites

- **GCP Project:** An existing Google Cloud project with billing enabled.
- **IAM Permissions:** The user executing this plan requires sufficient IAM permissions in the GCP project (e.g., roles like `roles/owner`, or a combination including `compute.admin`, `iam.serviceAccountAdmin`, `aiplatform.admin`, `serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`, `resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`) to enable APIs, manage IAM policies, and create/manage Vertex AI Workbench instances.
- **Service Account:** The dedicated service account (`happypatterns@...`) must exist.
- **Tools:** `gcloud` CLI installed locally or access via Google Cloud Shell.
- **Repository Access:** Access to clone the Timekeeper Git repository.

---

## Phase 1: GCP Foundation & Security Alignment

**Goal:** Verify and document the GCP environment configuration aligns with Workbench needs and Timekeeper's security patterns.

### Task 1.1: Verify API Enablement

- **Objective:** Confirm necessary GCP APIs are enabled.
- **Actions:**
  - Navigate to GCP Console -> APIs & Services -> Enabled APIs.
  - Verify `Vertex AI API` (aiplatform.googleapis.com) is listed and enabled.
  - Verify `Compute Engine API` (compute.googleapis.com) is listed and enabled.
- **Deliverable:** Confirmation screenshot or note added to this plan's execution log.

### Task 1.2: Review IAM & Service Account Permissions

- **Objective:** Ensure the dedicated Service Account (`happypatterns@...`) has the minimum necessary permissions for Workbench operations.
- **Actions:**
  - Review roles currently assigned (Ref: `docs/reference/gcp-consultant-recommendation.md`, `memory-bank/decisionLog.md [2025-03-29 21:24:00]`). Current roles: `roles/aiplatform.user`, `roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent`, `roles/compute.serviceAgent`.
  - Analyze potential future needs (e.g., specific GCS bucket access for research data, calling specific Vertex AI model endpoints).
  - If additional permissions are needed, grant them following the principle of least privilege via GCP Console IAM or `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding`.
  - **Note:** Start with the existing roles. Only add specific permissions (e.g., `roles/storage.objectViewer` for a specific bucket) if a workflow in Phase 3 explicitly fails due to lack of access. Avoid overly broad roles.
- **Deliverable:** Documented confirmation of roles (or justification for changes) in this plan's execution log. Updated `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` if roles are changed.

### Task 1.3: Document Workbench Authentication Strategy

- **Objective:** Clearly document how user and service account authentication works specifically for Workbench within the Timekeeper project.
- **Actions:**
  - Create a new section in an appropriate dev guide (e.g., `docs/dev-guides/gcp-integration.md` or create `docs/dev-guides/vertex-ai-workbench-setup.md`).
  - Explain:
    - Users access the JupyterLab UI via their own GCP identity (User ADC).
    - The Workbench _instance_ runs _as_ the dedicated Service Account (`happypatterns@...`).
    - Code run _within_ the instance authenticates to other GCP services using the Service Account's permissions automatically.
  - Add a cross-reference note to `memory-bank/gcp-credentials-integration.md`.
- **Deliverable:** New/updated section in the developer guide. Note added to `memory-bank/gcp-credentials-integration.md`.

### Task 1.4: Finalize Network Configuration Decision

- **Objective:** Decide and document the networking setup for Workbench instances.
- **Actions:**
  - Evaluate if instances need placement in a specific VPC/subnet or require Private Google Access.
  - Default VPC is the initial assumption unless specific needs arise.
  - Document the decision (e.g., "Default VPC sufficient for initial phase") and rationale.
- **Deliverable:** Documented decision added to `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` or a dedicated networking section/document.

### Task 1.5: Verify Budget Alerts

- **Objective:** Ensure cost monitoring is in place.
- **Actions:**
  - Navigate to GCP Console -> Billing -> Budgets & alerts.
  - Confirm an active budget alert exists for the project encompassing Compute Engine and Vertex AI costs.
- **Deliverable:** Confirmation screenshot or note added to this plan's execution log.

### Task 1.6: Update Memory Bank (Phase 1 Completion)

- **Objective:** Record the completion of Phase 1 foundational work.
- **Actions:**
  - Update `memory-bank/progress.md`: Mark Phase 1 tasks as complete.
  - Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Note completion of foundational setup.
  - Update `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`: Add entries for any specific decisions made (e.g., final network config).
- **Deliverable:** Updated Memory Bank files.

    - **Instance Type:** Vertex AI Managed Notebooks
    - **Region:** `us-central1` (or other preferred region)
    - **Environment:** `Python 3 (with IntelÂ® MKL)` (Image Family: `python-3-notebooks` or similar standard Python 3.11+ environment)
    - **Machine Type:** `e2-standard-4` (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM - adjust based on typical workload, monitor cost)
    - **GPU:** None (Add if required for specific ML tasks)
    - **Data disk:** 100 GB Standard Persistent Disk (adjust size if large datasets are stored locally)
    - **Service Account:** `happypatterns@...` (Ensure this is selected under 'Permission')
    - **Networking:** Default VPC network (Confirm based on Task 1.4 decision)
    - **Idle Shutdown:** Enabled, 60 minutes timeout (Crucial for cost control)
    - **Example `gcloud` command:**
      ```bash
      gcloud notebooks managed create timekeeper-workbench-std \

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

    echo "--- Updating package list and installing OS dependencies ---"
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv make pandoc git

    echo "--- Verifying Python version ---"
    python3.11 --version

    echo "--- Creating Python virtual environment '.venv' ---"
    python3.11 -m venv .venv

    echo "--- Activating virtual environment ---"
    source .venv/bin/activate

    echo "--- Upgrading pip ---"
    pip install --upgrade pip

    echo "--- Installing project dependencies (including dev/docs) from pyproject.toml ---"
    # Assuming dev/docs dependencies are specified correctly in pyproject.toml
    # Adjust if using requirements files (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt)
    pip install .[dev,docs] # Or adjust based on actual extras_require keys

    # If docs tools aren't in pyproject.toml extras:
    # echo "--- Installing documentation tools ---"
    # pip install sphinx quartodoc <specific versions if needed>

    echo "--- Verifying gcloud CLI ---"
    gcloud --version

    echo "--- Environment setup complete! ---"
    echo "To activate the environment, run: source .venv/bin/activate"
    ```
