# Adaptive Temporal System

> **Note**: This is a placeholder document that needs to be filled with detailed implementation information.

## Overview

The Adaptive Temporal System extends the core Agent Temporal system with dynamic adjustment capabilities, allowing the temporal framework to adapt its granularity and resolution based on context, workload, and resource constraints.

## Mathematical Foundation

This implementation is based on the following theoretical concepts:

- [Temporal Universe](../theory/temporal_universe.md) and [Hierarchical Partition](../theory/hierarchical_partition.md)
- [Lattice Structure](../theory/lattice_structure.md) (Definition 21) for understanding relationships between different temporal granularities
- Adaptive optimization algorithms for determining optimal temporal resolution

## Implementation Details

### Class Structure

```python
class TemporalContext:
    """Context information for adaptation."""

    def __init__(self, workload: float, resource_constraints: dict, task_characteristics: dict):
        """Initialize with context information."""

class AdaptationStrategy:
    """Strategy for adapting temporal granularity."""

    def get_optimal_granularity(self, context: TemporalContext) -> list[int]:
        """Determine optimal granularity based on context."""

class AdaptiveAgentTemporal(AgentTemporal):
    """Main interface for adaptive temporal operations."""

    def __init__(self, initial_coefficients: list[int],
                 strategy: AdaptationStrategy = None):
        """Initialize with initial coefficients and adaptation strategy."""

    def update_context(self, context: TemporalContext) -> None:
        """Update the context and potentially adapt the temporal system."""

    def adapt(self) -> bool:
        """Adapt the temporal system based on current context."""

    def get_current_coefficients(self) -> list[int]:
        """Get the current partition coefficients."""
```

### Adaptation Strategies

The system implements various adaptation strategies:

- **Fixed Intervals**: No adaptation, suitable for simple, predictable environments
- **Load-based**: Adapt based on computational load, adjusting granularity to match resource availability
- **Task-based**: Adapt based on task characteristics, providing finer granularity for complex tasks
- **Learning-based**: Use reinforcement learning to optimize granularity based on experience

### Adaptation Process

1. Context monitoring collects information about system state
2. Strategy evaluation determines if adaptation is needed
3. Coefficient calculation computes optimal new partition coefficients
4. Temporal system reconfiguration applies the new coefficients
5. State migration preserves temporal consistency across reconfigurations
