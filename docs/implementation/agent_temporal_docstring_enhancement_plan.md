# AgentTemporal Docstring Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for enhancing the docstrings in the `AgentTemporal` class with LaTeX formulas and cross-references to theoretical documentation. This implementation follows the guidelines in the [Docstring Enhancement Guide](docstring_enhancement_guide.md).

## Current State

The current docstrings in `AgentTemporal` provide basic information about the class and its methods, with references to mathematical concepts but without formal LaTeX notation or detailed cross-references.

## Enhancement Goals

1. Add formal mathematical definitions using LaTeX notation
2. Include cross-references to theoretical documentation
3. Clearly connect implementation details with mathematical concepts
4. Provide comprehensive examples for methods
5. Document mathematical properties and theorems

## Implementation Details

### Class Docstring Enhancement

Current:

```python
class AgentTemporal:
    """
    Maps directly to the fundamental time system described in the paper, covering:
      - The 'Temporal Universe' T (Definition 1)
      - Hierarchical partitions {Pi_0, Pi_1, ..., Pi_n} (Definitions 2-4)
      - Subdivision factors k_{i+1} (Definition 5)
      - Timepoints (Definition 6), plus canonical normalization (Definition 7)
      - Operations: addition, subtraction, compare, etc. (Axioms of temporal addition/subtraction)
      - Absolute representation in base units (Definition 9)

    NOTE: The dictionary-based representation of timepoints is the software analog
    to the tuple (a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}) in the math doc.
    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
class AgentTemporal:
    """
    A comprehensive implementation of a hierarchical temporal system for agents.

    Mathematical Foundation:
    -----------------------
    This class implements the Temporal Universe (ùíØ) defined as:

    \[ ùíØ = (T, \{\Pi_0, \Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_n\}, \{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\}) \]

    where:
    - $T$ is the time domain (Definition 1)
    - $\Pi_i$ are hierarchical partitions of $T$ (Definitions 2-4)
    - $k_i$ are subdivision factors: $|\Pi_{i-1}(t)| = k_i \cdot |\Pi_i(t)|$ (Definition 5)

    Timepoints are represented as tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ where $a_i$
    represents a coordinate in partition $\Pi_i$ (Definition 6). The dictionary-based
    implementation maps unit names to these coordinates.

    Key Mathematical Properties:
    --------------------------
    1. Canonical Form: Every timepoint has a unique canonical representation
       where $0 \leq a_i < k_{i+1}$ for $0 \leq i < n-1$ (Definition 7)

    2. Temporal Addition (‚äï): Defined as coordinate-wise addition followed by
       normalization to canonical form (Axiom 1)

    3. Temporal Subtraction (‚äñ): Inverse of addition, defined only when the
       result remains non-negative (Axiom 2)

    4. Absolute Representation: Every timepoint can be represented as an
       absolute value in the base units: $|\\tau|_{U_n}$ (Definition 9)

### `__init__` Method Enhancement

Current:

```python
def __init__(self, unit_config=None):
    """
    Args:
        unit_config: Optional custom specification of the hierarchy of time units.
                     If None, a default set of partitions is used.
    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
def __init__(self, unit_config=None):
    """

    This constructor establishes a Temporal Universe ùíØ with the given hierarchical
    partitions and subdivision factors:

    \[ ùíØ = (T, \{\Pi_0, \Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_n\}, \{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\}) \]

    The hierarchical structure is defined by the `unit_config` parameter, which
    specifies the names and subdivision factors for each level of the hierarchy.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    unit_config : list of dict, optional
        Custom specification of the hierarchy of time units. Each dictionary should
        contain:
        - "name": The name of the time unit (string)
        - "subdivisions": How many units of the next finer level fit into one unit
                         of this level (int), or None for the base unit
        - "is_base": True if this is the base (finest) unit, False otherwise

        If None, a default set of partitions is used:
        - epoch (24 cycles per epoch)
        - cycle (60 steps per cycle)
        - step (1000 microsteps per step)
        - microstep (base unit)

    References:
    ----------
    - See [Temporal Universe](/docs/theory/temporal_universe.md#definitions) for

### `_compute_conversions` Method Enhancement

Current:

```python
def _compute_conversions(self):
    """

    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
def _compute_conversions(self):
    """

    Mathematical Definition:

    \[ c_{i,j} = \frac{|\Pi_j(t)|}{|\Pi_i(t)|} = \begin{cases}
       \prod_{l=i+1}^{j} k_l & \text{if } i < j \\

       \frac{1}{\prod_{l=j+1}^{i} k_l} & \text{if } i > j
    \end{cases} \]

    where $|\Pi_i(t)|$ is the size of the partition $\Pi_i$ containing $t$, and
    $k_l$ are the subdivision factors.

    These conversion factors are used to efficiently perform operations like
    addition, subtraction, and comparison by providing a quick way to convert
    between different levels of the temporal hierarchy.

def create_timepoint(self, **kwargs):
    """
    Creates a timepoint dictionary, e.g. (a_0, ..., a_{n-1}) in the paper,
    from the user-specified partial info. Missing units default to 0.
    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
def create_timepoint(self, **kwargs):
    """
    Create a timepoint with specified unit values.

    Mathematical Definition:
    ----------------------
    This method creates a timepoint $\tau = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ where
    each $a_i$ represents a coordinate in partition $\Pi_i$. The implementation
    represents this as a dictionary mapping unit names to values.

    The timepoint is automatically normalized to canonical form, where
    $0 \leq a_i < k_{i+1}$ for $0 \leq i < n-1$.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    **kwargs : dict
        Unit values specified as keyword arguments (e.g., epoch=1, cycle=10).
        Units not specified default to 0.

    Returns:

    the value is in [0, subdivisions_i), by carrying over to the coarser unit
    if necessary.
    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
def normalize(self, timepoint):
    """
    Normalize a timepoint to its canonical form.

    Mathematical Definition:
    ----------------------
    This method implements the normalization function $\mathcal{N}$ that
    converts a timepoint to its canonical form:

    \[ \mathcal{N}(\tau) = (b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n-1}) \]

    where:
    - $\tau = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ is the input timepoint
    - For all $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, n-2\}$, $0 \leq b_i < k_{i+1}$
    - $|\tau|_{U_n} = |\mathcal{N}(\tau)|_{U_n}$ (absolute representation is preserved)

    The normalization process ensures that each coordinate is within the
    appropriate range for its position in the hierarchy, carrying excess
    values to coarser units when necessary.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    timepoint : dict
        A dictionary mapping unit names to values, representing a timepoint
        that may not be in canonical form.

    Returns:

      details on time difference calculation.

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> temporal = AgentTemporal()
    >>> t1 = temporal.create_timepoint(epoch=1, cycle=10, step=30)
    >>> t2 = temporal.create_timepoint(epoch=1, cycle=15, step=40)

    >>> # Calculate difference
    >>> diff = temporal.time_difference(t1, t2)
    >>> # Result: {'epoch': 0, 'cycle': 5, 'step': 10, 'microstep': 0}
    >>>
    >>> # Order doesn't matter for absolute difference
    >>> diff_rev = temporal.time_difference(t2, t1)
    >>> # Result is the same: {'epoch': 0, 'cycle': 5, 'step': 10, 'microstep': 0}

### `from_human_time` Method Enhancement

Current:

```python
def from_human_time(self, human_dict):
    """
    Suppose human_dict = {"seconds": 30, "minutes": 2},
    and we've decided to map e.g. "step" -> "seconds", "cycle" -> "minutes", etc.
    This method is the morphism phi^-1: H -> T in the paper.
    For simplicity, we assume the keys match some known mapping in code.
    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
def from_human_time(self, human_dict):
    """
    Convert human time to agent time.

    Mathematical Definition:
    ----------------------
    This method implements the inverse morphism $\phi^{-1}: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{T}$
    from human time to agent time:

    \[ \phi^{-1}(h) = \mathcal{N}(\sum_{i \in I_h} h_i \cdot e_{\mu(i)}) \]

    where:
    - $h = (h_i)_{i \in I_h}$ is the human time representation
    - $\mu: I_h \rightarrow I_{\tau}$ is the mapping from human time units to agent time units
    - $e_j$ is the unit vector with 1 in position $j$ and 0 elsewhere
    - $\mathcal{N}$ is the normalization function

    Parameters:
    ----------
    human_dict : dict
        A dictionary mapping human time units to values
        (e.g., {"hours": 1, "minutes": 30, "seconds": 45}).

    Returns:
    -------
    dict
        A timepoint in the agent temporal universe equivalent to the given human time.

    Raises:
    ------
    ValueError
        If a human time unit is not recognized.

    References:
    ----------
    - See [Morphisms](/docs/theory/morphisms.md#definition-3-human-agent-morphism) for
      details on the human-agent morphism.

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> temporal = AgentTemporal()
    >>> # Convert human time to agent time
    >>> human_time = {"hours": 2, "minutes": 15, "seconds": 30}
    >>> agent_time = temporal.from_human_time(human_time)
    >>> # Result: {'epoch': 2, 'cycle': 15, 'step': 30, 'microstep': 0}
    >>>
    >>> # Convert partial human time
    >>> partial_time = {"minutes": 30}
    >>> agent_partial = temporal.from_human_time(partial_time)
    >>> # Result: {'epoch': 0, 'cycle': 30, 'step': 0, 'microstep': 0}
    """
```

### `to_human_time` Method Enhancement

Current:

```python
def to_human_time(self, agent_tp):
    """
    The direct morphism phi: T -> H from the paper (Definition 18).
    We reverse the mapping above, e.g. step->seconds, cycle->minutes, ...
    """
```

Enhanced:

```python
def to_human_time(self, agent_tp):
    """
    Convert agent time to human time.

    Mathematical Definition:
    ----------------------
    This method implements the morphism $\phi: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$
    from agent time to human time:

    \[ \phi(\tau) = (h_i)_{i \in I_h} \text{ where } h_i = \tau_{\mu^{-1}(i)} \]

    where:
    - $\tau = (\tau_j)_{j \in I_{\tau}}$ is the agent timepoint
    - $\mu^{-1}: I_{\tau} \rightarrow I_h$ is the inverse mapping from agent time units to human time units

    Parameters:
    ----------
    agent_tp : dict
        A timepoint in the agent temporal universe.

    Returns:
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary mapping human time units to values.

    References:
    ----------
    - See [Morphisms](/docs/theory/morphisms.md#definition-2-agent-human-morphism) for
      details on the agent-human morphism.

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> temporal = AgentTemporal()
    >>> # Convert agent time to human time
    >>> agent_tp = temporal.create_timepoint(epoch=1, cycle=30, step=45)
    >>> human_time = temporal.to_human_time(agent_tp)
    >>> # Result: {'hours': 1, 'minutes': 30, 'seconds': 45}
    """
```

## Implementation Steps

To implement these docstring enhancements, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Backup**:

   ```bash
   cp src/python/agent_temporal.py src/python/agent_temporal.py.backup
   ```

2. **Open the File**:

   ```bash
   nano src/python/agent_temporal.py
   ```

3. **Replace Docstrings**:

   - Replace each docstring with its enhanced version
   - Start with the class docstring
   - Proceed through each method
   - Be careful not to modify any code, only the docstrings

4. **Verify LaTeX Syntax**:

   - Ensure all LaTeX formulas use proper syntax
   - Check for balanced delimiters: `\[...\]`, `$...$`
   - Verify escape sequences for backslashes in string literals

5. **Check Cross-References**:

   - Verify that all links to theory documentation use correct paths
   - Ensure anchors in the URLs match the actual headings in the target documents

6. **Test Documentation Generation**:
   - Run the documentation generation tools to verify that the LaTeX renders correctly
   - Check that cross-references resolve properly

## Validation Criteria

After implementation, the docstring enhancements should:

1. **Provide Mathematical Rigor**:

   - Formal definitions with proper LaTeX notation
   - Clear connection between mathematical concepts and implementation

2. **Support Bidirectional Traceability**:

   - Links from code to theory documentation
   - References to specific definitions, properties, and theorems

3. **Improve Documentation Quality**:

   - Clear examples for all methods
   - Consistent formatting and structure
   - Comprehensive parameter and return value documentation

4. **Maintain Readability**:
   - LaTeX should enhance, not hinder, understanding
   - Code examples should be clear and instructive
   - References should be helpful and relevant

## Next Steps

After enhancing the `AgentTemporal` class docstrings, proceed to:

1. **Test Documentation Generation**: Verify that Sphinx correctly renders the LaTeX formulas
2. **Enhance `TaskScheduler` Docstrings**: Apply similar enhancements to the `TaskScheduler` class
3. **Enhance `AdaptiveAgentTemporal` Docstrings**: Apply similar enhancements to the `AdaptiveAgentTemporal` class
4. **Update Examples**: Ensure the documentation examples are consistent with the enhanced docstrings
