# Agent Temporal System

> **Note**: This is a placeholder document that needs to be filled with detailed implementation information.

## Overview

The Agent Temporal System is the core implementation of the temporal framework, providing fundamental time representation and operations for agent systems based on the mathematical theory of temporal universes and hierarchical partitions.

## Mathematical Foundation

This implementation is based on the following theoretical concepts:

- [Temporal Universe](../theory/temporal_universe.md) (Definition 1)
- [Hierarchical Partition](../theory/hierarchical_partition.md) (Definition 2)
- [Timepoint Operations](../theory/timepoint_operations.md) (Definitions 6-8)

## Implementation Details

### Class Structure

```python
class AgentTemporal:
    """Main interface for temporal operations in agent systems."""

    def __init__(self, partition_coefficients: list[int]):
        """Initialize with coefficients defining the temporal hierarchy."""

    def create_timepoint(self, coordinates: list[int]) -> TimePoint:
        """Create a timepoint from hierarchical coordinates."""

    def add(self, timepoint: TimePoint, interval: TimeInterval) -> TimePoint:
        """Add an interval to a timepoint."""

    def subtract(self, timepoint1: TimePoint, timepoint2: TimePoint) -> TimeInterval:
        """Calculate the interval between two timepoints."""

    def compare(self, timepoint1: TimePoint, timepoint2: TimePoint) -> int:
        """Compare two timepoints, returning -1, 0, or 1."""

    def to_human_time(self, timepoint: TimePoint) -> datetime:
        """Convert agent timepoint to human-readable time."""

    def from_human_time(self, dt: datetime) -> TimePoint:
        """Convert human-readable time to agent timepoint."""
```

### Key Features

- Hierarchical representation of time with arbitrary depth
- Mathematically rigorous operations on timepoints
- Bidirectional conversion between agent time and human time
- Support for temporal intervals and comparisons
