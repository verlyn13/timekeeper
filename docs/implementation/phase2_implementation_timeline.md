# Phase 2 Implementation Timeline

This document outlines the recommended timeline for completing Phase 2 of the Timekeeper project. It provides a structured approach to implementing the tasks identified in the Phase 2 implementation plan.

## Overview

Phase 2 implementation focuses on three key areas:

1. Integration testing
2. Docstring enhancement with LaTeX formulas
3. Example suite development

The timeline is organized into two-week sprints, with specific deliverables for each sprint.

## Sprint 1: Integration Testing Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Definition of Done**:

- All workflow tests pass consistently

- Edge cases and error conditions are handled appropriately

## Sprint 2: Visualization and Documentation (Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3: Visualization Integration

**Focus**: Implement visualization integration tests

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create `tests/integration/test_visualization_integration.py`

- [ ] Implement timeline visualization tests
- [ ] Implement schedule visualization tests
- [ ] Implement adaptive visualization tests

**Definition of Done**:

- All visualization tests pass consistently
- Visual output is verified (through assertions on figure properties)
- Tests cover all visualization components

### Week 4: Docstring Enhancement

**Focus**: Enhance docstrings with LaTeX formulas

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Update `agent_temporal.py` docstrings following the LaTeX style guide
- [ ] Add cross-references to theory documentation
- [ ] Verify LaTeX rendering in Sphinx-generated documentation
- [ ] Update `task_scheduler.py` docstrings with LaTeX formulas
- [ ] Begin updating `adaptive_agent_temporal.py` docstrings

**Definition of Done**:

- Docstrings include properly formatted LaTeX formulas
- Cross-references to theory documentation are correct
- Sphinx documentation builds successfully with rendered formulas

## Sprint 3: Documentation Completion (Weeks 5-6)

### Week 5: Docstring Enhancement Completion

**Focus**: Complete docstring enhancement for all components

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Complete `adaptive_agent_temporal.py` docstring updates
- [ ] Update `visualization.py` docstrings with LaTeX formulas
- [ ] Verify consistency across all docstrings
- [ ] Update any helper/utility functions with appropriate documentation
- [ ] Cross-check against LaTeX style guide for consistency

**Definition of Done**:

- All core component docstrings include LaTeX formulas
- Consistent notation is used across all components
- All docstrings build correctly in Sphinx documentation

### Week 6: Examples and Documentation Integration

**Focus**: Develop comprehensive examples and integrate documentation

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create complete workflow example in `docs/examples/`
- [ ] Create specialized examples for specific use cases
- [ ] Update theory documentation to reference implementation
- [ ] Verify bidirectional traceability between theory and implementation
- [ ] Test all examples to ensure they work correctly

**Definition of Done**:

- Examples demonstrate all key framework capabilities
- Documentation is well-integrated with clear cross-references
- All examples run successfully and produce expected results

## Sprint 4: Finalization and Validation (Weeks 7-8)

### Week 7: Performance and Usability

**Focus**: Optimize performance and improve API usability

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Add convenience methods for common operations
- [ ] Improve error messages with more context
- [ ] Create factory methods for standard configuration patterns
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect API improvements

**Definition of Done**:

- Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- API is user-friendly with clear error messages
- Convenience methods simplify common operations

### Week 8: Final Testing and Documentation

**Focus**: Final integration testing and documentation review

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Verify documentation completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Build combined Sphinx-Quarto documentation
- [ ] Address any remaining issues or gaps
- [ ] Prepare for MVP release

**Definition of Done**:

- All tests pass consistently
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Both Sphinx and Quarto build successfully
- MVP is ready for release

## Phase 2 Completion Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the completion of Phase 2:

- [ ] No duplication across documentation types

### Example Suite

- [ ] Complete workflow example created
- [ ] Specialized examples for specific use cases
- [ ] All examples run successfully
- [ ] Examples cover all key framework capabilities
- [ ] Examples integrated with documentation

### API and Performance

- [ ] Convenience methods added for common operations
- [ ] Factory methods for standard configurations
- [ ] Improved error messages with context
- [ ] Performance optimized for critical operations
- [ ] API usability validated

### Final Integration

## Critical Path

The critical path for Phase 2 completion is:

1. Task Scheduler Integration Tests → Workflow Integration Tests → Visualization Integration Tests
2. Docstring Enhancement (agent_temporal.py first, then others)
3. Example Suite Development
4. API and Performance Optimization
5. Final Integration and Testing

Maintaining this sequence ensures that we verify integration points first, then improve documentation with verified implementation details, and finally demonstrate capabilities through examples.
