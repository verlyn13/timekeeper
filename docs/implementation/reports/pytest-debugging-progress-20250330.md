# Pytest Debugging Progress Report - 2025-03-30

**Objective:** Resolve test failures encountered after setting up the Vertex AI Workbench environment and attempting to run the `pytest` suite.

**Summary:**

Significant progress has been made in resolving environment setup, Python path configuration, and test fixture issues that initially prevented the test suite from running correctly. The focus has now shifted to addressing logic errors within the application code or test assertions revealed by the passing test collection phase.

**Debugging Steps & Resolutions:**

1.  **Initial Problem:** Tests failed during collection (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`) both locally and on the VM.

2.  **Environment Setup (VM):**

    - Identified the initial VM image (`common-cpu`) lacked the required Python 3.11+.
    - Re-provisioned the VM (`timekeeper-workbench-std` in `us-west1-a`) using an Ubuntu 22.04 / Python 3.10 base image (`common-cpu-notebooks-ubuntu-2204-py310`), which was confirmed to include Python 3.11 (`3.11.0rc1`).
    - Simplified the `scripts/setup_workbench_env.sh` script to use the system's Python 3.11 and `venv`, removing the complex `pyenv` installation steps.
    - Successfully ran the setup script on the VM (after correcting execution path).

3.  **Path/Import Issues:**

    - Persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` errors indicated issues with Python finding the `src` directory during testing, especially when run remotely via `gcloud compute ssh`.
    - Experimented with `pip install -e .` (editable install), requiring quoting (`'.'`) for Zsh compatibility locally.
    - Attempted alternative `pyproject.toml` configurations (`[tool.hatch.build.sources]`) which led to different import errors (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'python'`) due to incorrect `hatchling` configuration for editable installs with `src` layout.
    - **Resolution:** Reverted `pyproject.toml` to use `packages = ["src/python"]` under `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]`. Added `pythonpath = ["."]` to `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml`. Reverted all test file imports back to `from src.python...`. This combination successfully resolved test collection errors locally.

4.  **Fixture Errors:**

    - Resolved `fixture 'self' not found` by removing the `self` parameter from a non-method test function (`test_temporal_adaptation_effect`).
    - Resolved `fixture 'adaptive_scheduler' not found` by creating `tests/integration/conftest.py` and defining the `adaptive_scheduler` and `adaptive_temporal` fixtures there, removing the duplicate from `test_time_flow.py`.
    - Resolved `TypeError: TaskScheduler.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'temporal_agent'` by correcting the parameter name to `temporal_system` in the `adaptive_scheduler` fixture definition in `conftest.py`.

5.  **Test Logic Failures (AssertionErrors):**
    - **Fixed:** `test_timepoint_creation` - Corrected assertions based on the default config (1 epoch = 24 cycles).
    - **Fixed:** `test_timepoint_addition` - Corrected assertions based on normalization logic.
    - **Fixed:** `test_timepoint_subtraction` (`DID NOT RAISE ValueError`) - Corrected the test case to subtract a larger value, properly triggering the expected error condition.

**Major Lessons Learned:**

- **Environment Consistency:** Differences between local and remote environments (OS, Python patch version, shell) can significantly impact build and test execution.
- **Build/Test Configuration:** Correctly configuring `pyproject.toml` for the build backend (`hatchling`) and `pytest` (`pythonpath`) is essential for `src`-layout projects. Relying solely on editable installs might not be sufficient in all contexts without careful configuration.
- **Test Accuracy:** Test assertions must accurately reflect the expected outcome based on the code's logic and configuration (e.g., default time units). Several failures were due to incorrect test expectations.
- **Local Iteration:** Debugging and testing locally before deploying/testing on the VM is significantly more efficient.

**Remaining Issues & Next Steps:**

The test suite now collects successfully locally. The remaining work involves fixing the outstanding test failures:

- **Assertion Failures (15):** Logic errors in the code or incorrect assertions in tests like `test_timepoint_comparison`, `test_to_human_time`, `test_add_time_unit`, `test_normalization`, etc.
- **Hypothesis Health Checks (5):** Warnings about using function-scoped fixtures with `@given`. Needs review for potential test design improvements or suppression.
- **Deprecation Warnings:** Warnings about invalid escape sequences in docstrings need cleanup (e.g., using raw strings).

The immediate next step is to continue debugging the `AssertionError` failures locally, starting with `test_timepoint_comparison`.
