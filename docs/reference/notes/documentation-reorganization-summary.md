# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Completed Actions

The documentation has been reorganized according to the plan outlined in `docs/documentation-organization-plan.md`. The following actions have been completed:

### 1. Directory Structure Creation

The following directory structure has been created:

```
docs/
├── architecture/        # Architecture documentation
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── system-overview.md
│   └── development-roadmap.md
├── reference/           # Reference materials
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── integration-plans/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── sphinx-quarto-integration.md
│   ├── migration-guides/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── sphinx-quarto-migration.md
│   ├── notes/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── sphinx-quarto-organization.md
│   └── role-definitions/
│       └── README.md
└── README.md            # Updated main documentation README
```

### 2. Document Consolidation

The following documents have been consolidated:

- **Architecture Documentation**:

  - `docs/architecture-specification.md` and `docs/updated-architecture-specification.md` → `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`
  - `docs/implementation-plan.md` and `docs/mvp-development-roadmap.md` → `docs/architecture/development-roadmap.md`

- **Integration Plans**:

  - `docs/sphinx-quarto-integration-plan.md` and `docs/sphinx-quarto-implementation-steps.md` → `docs/reference/integration-plans/sphinx-quarto-integration.md`

- **Migration Guides**:

  - `docs/migration-plan-sphinx-quarto.md` → `docs/reference/migration-guides/sphinx-quarto-migration.md`

- **Notes**:
  - `docs/notes/sphinx-quarto-organization.md` → `docs/reference/notes/sphinx-quarto-organization.md`

### 3. README Creation

README files have been created for each major directory to explain its purpose and contents.

## Next Steps

The following steps are needed to complete the documentation reorganization:

### 1. Theory Documentation

Create and organize theory documentation as per the research-oriented architecture:

```
docs/theory/
├── temporal_universe.md
├── hierarchical_partition.md
├── timepoint_operations.md
├── morphisms.md
└── lattice_structure.md
```

### 2. Implementation Documentation

Create and organize implementation documentation:

```
docs/implementation/
├── agent_temporal.md
├── task_scheduler.md
├── adaptive_system.md
└── api/  # Will contain Sphinx-generated API docs
```

### 3. Research Documentation

Create and organize research documentation:

```
docs/research/
├── hypotheses/
├── experiments/
└── results/
```

### 4. Additional Reference Materials

Move sample Roo configuration files from `docs/role_definitions/sample-roo-configs/` to `docs/reference/role-definitions/sample-roo-configs/`.

### 5. Clean-up

Remove original files once migration is confirmed successful and all content has been preserved.

### 6. Update Build Scripts

Update documentation build scripts to align with the new directory structure:

- Modify `scripts/build_docs.py`
- Create component-specific build scripts if needed

## Impact on Memory Bank

The Memory Bank has been updated to reflect this reorganization:

- `decisionLog.md`: Added entry for the documentation reorganization decision
- `progress.md`: Added the documentation reorganization as a completed task
- `activeContext.md`: Updated to reflect the current focus on documentation organization
- `systemPatterns.md`: Added the structured documentation organization pattern

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Migration**: Focus on migrating theory and implementation documentation next
2. **Update Build Scripts**: Ensure build scripts are updated to work with the new structure
3. **Verify Cross-References**: Update all cross-references between documents to use new paths
4. **Consider CI/CD Updates**: Update any CI/CD pipeline configurations to work with new paths
5. **Documentation Testing**: Test the documentation builds after reorganization
