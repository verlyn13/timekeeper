# Sample Roo Configurations

This directory contains sample configuration files for different Roo assistant roles used in the Timekeeper project.

## Contents

- **roo-workflow-guide.md**: Guide for using Roo in the development workflow

## Files to be Moved (Requires Code Mode)

The following files need to be moved from `docs/role_definitions/sample-roo-configs/` to this directory, but require Code mode because they are not markdown files:

- **.potential-roomodes**: Potential Roo modes configuration
- **.potential-clinerules-timekeeper-architect**: Potential CLI rules for the architect role
- **.potential-clinerules-timekeeper-docs**: Potential CLI rules for the documentation role

## Action Required

To complete the migration:

1. Switch to Code mode
2. Copy the following files from the original location to this directory:
   - `docs/role_definitions/sample-roo-configs/.potential-roomodes`
   - `docs/role_definitions/sample-roo-configs/.potential-clinerules-timekeeper-architect`
   - `docs/role_definitions/sample-roo-configs/.potential-clinerules-timekeeper-docs`

## Purpose

These configuration files provide templates and examples for setting up Roo Code assistants with custom modes specific to the Timekeeper project. They demonstrate how to configure the Architect and Documentation Specialist roles with appropriate permissions and instructions.
