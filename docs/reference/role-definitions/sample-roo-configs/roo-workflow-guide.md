# Timekeeper Project: Roo Code Workflow Guide

This guide explains how to leverage Roo Code's custom modes to enhance the development workflow for the Timekeeper project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Place these files in your project root directory:

   - `.roomodes` - The main configuration file defining our custom modes
   - `.clinerules-timekeeper-architect` - Specific rules for the architect role
   - `.clinerules-timekeeper-docs` - Specific rules for the documentation specialist role

2. Install and configure Roo Code in VS Code:
   - Install the Roo Code extension
   - Configure your API key (Claude 3.7 Sonnet recommended)
   - Verify that your custom modes appear in the Roo Code mode selector

## Enhanced Workflow

### Development Cycle

The custom modes enable a streamlined development workflow:

1. **Initial Planning Phase**

   - Start in **Architect** mode to plan the system architecture
   - Use Roo to generate architectural diagrams and component specifications
   - Create initial stub implementations of core components

2. **Documentation Framework Setup**

   - Switch to **Documentation Specialist** mode
   - Generate Quarto project structure and templates
   - Establish metadata system and glossary foundation

3. **Core Development**

   - Return to **Architect** mode for implementing core components
   - Use Roo to generate tests and implementation code
   - Commit MVP components according to priority list

4. **Documentation Integration**

   - Switch to **Documentation Specialist** mode
   - Document implemented components with math-to-code mapping
   - Generate interactive examples and visualizations

5. **Continuous Development**
   - Iterate between modes as needed for different tasks
   - Use mode-specific commands and tools

### Leveraging Mode-Specific Features

#### Architect Mode Capabilities

When in Architect mode, Roo Code will:

- Suggest implementations that follow mathematical rigor
- Generate comprehensive test suites for temporal properties
- Help set up Docker containers and CI/CD pipelines
- Assist with architectural decision documentation
- Focus on the MVP priority components

Example prompts:

- "Create a base class for the AgentTemporal system that implements the core mathematical properties"
- "Generate unit tests that verify the temporal invariants for the TaskScheduler"
- "Set up a Docker container configuration for the development environment"

#### Documentation Specialist Mode Capabilities

When in Documentation Specialist mode, Roo Code will:

- Generate structured Quarto documentation templates
- Create interactive visualizations for temporal concepts
- Build comprehensive glossary entries
- Implement metadata tagging system
- Assist with documentation automation

Example prompts:

- "Create a Quarto template for documenting mathematical concepts with code implementations"
- "Generate an interactive visualization for the temporal partitioning concept"
- "Set up the glossary structure with LaTeX and plain text definitions"
- "Create a metadata schema for the documentation system"

## Collaboration Workflow

The dual-mode system enhances collaboration:

1. **Code Review Integration**

   - Architect mode can review pull requests with focus on mathematical correctness
   - Documentation mode can review documentation PRs with focus on clarity and integration

2. **Paired Programming**

   - Developer A works in Architect mode implementing a component
   - Developer B works in Documentation mode documenting it simultaneously
   - Use Roo's understanding of both roles to coordinate work

3. **Milestone Planning**
   - Use Architect mode to plan technical milestones
   - Use Documentation mode to plan documentation deliverables
   - Align timelines through Roo's understanding of both aspects

## Advanced Features

### Using MCP for Extended Capabilities

The Model Context Protocol enables advanced integrations:

1. **GitHub Integration**

   - Track issues and PRs related to specific components
   - Automate documentation updates based on code changes

2. **Mathematical Verification**

   - Connect to mathematical proof systems to verify implementation correctness
   - Integrate with symbolic mathematics systems for validation

3. **Visualization Generation**
   - Use web tools to generate interactive visualizations
   - Connect to data visualization libraries for dynamic examples

### Autonomous Mode for Routine Tasks

For selected tasks, you can enable auto-approval:

1. **Documentation Generation**

   - Allow autonomous updates to documentation based on code changes
   - Auto-generate API documentation when interfaces change

2. **Test Generation**
   - Auto-generate test cases for new mathematical properties
   - Update test suite when implementation changes

## Conclusion

By leveraging these custom Roo Code modes, the Timekeeper project can maintain a tight integration between mathematical theory, code implementation, and documentation. The specialized roles ensure that both technical excellence and clear communication are prioritized throughout the development process.
