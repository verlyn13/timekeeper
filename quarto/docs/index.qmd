# Timekeeper Documentation

Welcome to the Timekeeper documentation. This comprehensive guide provides all the information you need to understand, install, and use the Timekeeper framework in your projects.

## Overview

Timekeeper is a hierarchical partition-based approach to temporal optimization in small-scale agent systems. It provides a formal mathematical framework for representing, manipulating, and reasoning about time in agent-based systems.

The framework is based on rigorous mathematical foundations, including:

- Temporal universes and hierarchical partitioning
- Timepoint representation and operations
- Human-agent temporal morphisms
- Dynamic adaptability and optimization
- Task scheduling with dependency constraints

## Quick Start

If you're new to Timekeeper, start with the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.html) for installation instructions and basic usage examples.
