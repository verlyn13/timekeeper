  status: "Active/Validated/Refuted/Modified"
  
  theoretical_basis:
    - definition_references: ["def-1", "def-2"]
    - theorem_references: ["thm-1"]
    - prior_hypotheses: ["H-previous"]
    
  experiments:
    - id: "EXP-001"
      title: "Experiment title"
      status: "Planned/In Progress/Completed"
      results_summary: "Brief summary of results"

    - contradicting: ["Evidence contradicting the hypothesis"]
    
  implications:
    - theoretical: ["Theoretical implications if validated"]
    - practical: ["Practical implications for implementation"]

  formulation_date: "2025-01-15"
  status: "Active"
  
  theoretical_basis:
    definition_references: ["subdivision-factor", "timepoint"]
    theorem_references: []
    prior_hypotheses: []
    
  experiments:
    - id: "EXP-001"
      title: "Subdivision Factor Impact on Scheduling Efficiency"
      status: "In Progress"
      results_summary: "Preliminary results suggest a non-linear relationship between subdivision factor and precision."
      
  evidence:
    supporting: 
      - "Computational complexity analysis shows linear increase in storage and processing requirements with subdivision factor size."
      - "Initial benchmarks show precision improvements plateauing around k_i = 120."
    contradicting: 
      - "Some edge cases with high-frequency operations show benefits beyond k_i = 150."
    
  implications:
    theoretical: 
      - "May suggest an optimal range for subdivision factors based on workload characteristics."

```yaml
hypothesis:
  id: "H-004"

  formulation_date: "2025-03-01"
  status: "Active"
  
  theoretical_basis:
    definition_references: ["task-dependency-graph", "temporal-schedule"]

## Hypothesis Development Process

New hypotheses are developed following this process:

1. **Identification**: Identify a gap in understanding or an opportunity for improvement.
2. **Formulation**: Develop a clear, testable statement based on theoretical foundations.
3. **Validation Planning**: Design experiments to test the hypothesis.
4. **Execution**: Conduct the experiments and collect data.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the results and their implications for the hypothesis.
6. **Refinement**: Validate, refute, or modify the hypothesis based on evidence.
7. **Documentation**: Update this tracking document with the latest status.

## Proposing New Hypotheses

Researchers can propose new hypotheses by:

1. Creating a formal hypothesis statement following the template
2. Providing theoretical justification and prior work
3. Outlining potential experimental approaches
4. Submitting the proposal for review

## Future Research Directions

Based on current hypotheses and findings, these are promising directions for future research:

1. **Cross-domain applicability**: Testing the framework's effectiveness in different application domains.
2. **Scalability limits**: Investigating the upper bounds on system size where the hierarchical approach remains effective.
3. **Learning mechanisms**: Exploring machine learning approaches to optimize temporal structures based on historical data.
