# Timekeeper Research Compendium

This section documents the ongoing research, experiments, and findings related to the Timekeeper framework. It serves as a living repository of the scientific exploration driving the project's development.

## Research Areas

The research is organized around several key areas:

### 1. Theoretical Foundations

Investigation of the mathematical properties of hierarchical temporal partitions, timepoint operations, and the lattice structure of partitions.

- [Theoretical Hypotheses](hypotheses.qmd): Formal conjectures about temporal properties
- [Mathematical Proofs](proofs.qmd): Formal verification of key theorems
- [Open Questions](open-questions.qmd): Unresolved theoretical challenges

### 2. Performance Optimization

Empirical investigation of performance characteristics and optimization opportunities.

- [Performance Models](performance-models.qmd): Analytical models of temporal efficiency
- [Benchmark Results](benchmarks.qmd): Standardized performance measurements
- [Optimization Strategies](optimization.qmd): Approaches to improving efficiency

### 3. Dynamic Adaptation

Research on adaptive mechanisms for temporal granularity.

- [Adaptation Algorithms](adaptation-algorithms.qmd): Methods for dynamic reconfiguration
- [Usage Pattern Analysis](usage-patterns.qmd): Statistical analysis of temporal operations
- [Feedback Mechanisms](feedback.qmd): Approaches to closed-loop adaptation

## Experimental Framework

All research follows a standardized experimental framework to ensure reproducibility and methodological rigor.

### Experiment Template

Each experiment is documented using a structured template:

```yaml
experiment:
  id: "EXP-001"
  title: "Subdivision Factor Impact on Scheduling Efficiency"
  date: "2025-03-15"
  researchers: ["Researcher A", "Researcher B"]
  
  hypothesis:
    statement: "Increasing the subdivision factor k_i beyond 100 for fine-grained units provides diminishing returns in scheduling precision while linearly increasing computational overhead."
    null_hypothesis: "There is no significant relationship between subdivision factor size and the precision/overhead tradeoff."
    
  methodology:
    independent_variables:
      - name: "subdivision_factor"
        values: [10, 50, 100, 500, 1000]
        unit: "subdivisions"
    dependent_variables:
      - name: "scheduling_precision"
        measurement: "Average temporal error in task start times"
        unit: "microsteps"
      - name: "computation_time"
        measurement: "CPU time required for scheduling"
        unit: "milliseconds"
    control_variables:
      - name: "task_count"
        value: 100
      - name: "dependency_density"
        value: 0.3
    
  procedure:
    - "Generate random task sets with the specified parameters"
    - "Schedule tasks using the AgentTemporal system with varying subdivision factors"
    - "Measure scheduling precision and computation time"
    - "Analyze the relationship between subdivision factor and the dependent variables"

### Research Workflow

The research workflow follows these stages:

1. **Hypothesis Formulation**: Define clear, testable hypotheses based on theoretical understanding or empirical observations.
2. **Experimental Design**: Create a reproducible experimental setup with well-defined variables and metrics.
3. **Implementation**: Develop the necessary code and infrastructure to conduct the experiment.
4. **Data Collection**: Run the experiment and collect data following the predefined methodology.
5. **Analysis**: Apply appropriate statistical methods to analyze the results.
6. **Interpretation**: Draw conclusions based on the analysis and update the theoretical understanding.
7. **Publication**: Document the findings in the research compendium and potentially in external publications.

## Current Research Focus

The current research focus for Q2 2025 is on:

1. **Optimal Subdivision Factors**: Determining the most efficient subdivision factors for different agent counts and workloads.
2. **Adaptation Heuristics**: Developing and testing heuristics for dynamic adaptation of the temporal structure.
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Investigating coordination patterns in 2-3 agent systems using the Timekeeper framework.

## Contributing to Research

Researchers interested in contributing to the Timekeeper project can:

1. **Explore Open Questions**: Review the list of [open questions](open-questions.qmd) to identify research gaps.
2. **Propose Experiments**: Submit experimental proposals following the template structure.
3. **Replicate Results**: Verify existing findings by replicating experiments.
4. **Extend the Framework**: Develop new theoretical extensions or implementation improvements.
