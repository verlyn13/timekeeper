## Overview

The Timekeeper framework is built on a robust mathematical foundation that defines time as a hierarchically partitioned structure with well-defined operations. This document outlines the core principles and mathematical constructs that form the basis of the framework.

## Temporal Universe and Hierarchical Partitions

The fundamental concept in Timekeeper is the **temporal universe** ($\mathcal{T}$), which is partitioned into a sequence of nested uniform partitions.

:::{.callout-note}
## Definition 1: Temporal Universe

Let $\mathcal{T}$ denote the temporal universe, a totally ordered set representing all possible time points in the system. We impose a strict total order $<_\mathcal{T}$ on $\mathcal{T}$, reflecting the sequential progression of time.
:::

This temporal universe is partitioned into hierarchical levels, where each level represents a different granularity of time.

:::{.callout-note}
## Definition 2: Hierarchical Temporal Partition

The temporal universe $\mathcal{T}$ is partitioned into a sequence of uniform nested partitions $\{\Pi_0, \Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_n\}$, where:

- $\Pi_0 = \{\mathcal{T}\}$ is the trivial partition containing the entire temporal universe.
- For each $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, $\Pi_i$ is a refinement of $\Pi_{i-1}$.
- Each partition $\Pi_i$ consists of uniform blocks of equal temporal measure.
- If $B \in \Pi_i$ and $B' \in \Pi_i$ are distinct blocks in the same partition, then either $\forall t \in B, t' \in B': t <_\mathcal{T} t'$ or $\forall t \in B, t' \in B': t' <_\mathcal{T} t$.
:::

The hierarchical nature of these partitions allows us to represent time at different levels of granularity, from coarse to fine.

```

## Timepoints and Operations

Within this partitioned temporal universe, we define **timepoints** as specific locations in time, represented as tuples that indicate positions within each partition level.

:::{.callout-note}
## Definition 6: Timepoint

A timepoint $\tau \in \mathcal{T}$ is represented as an ordered $n$-tuple $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ where:

- $a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ indicates the $U_0$ unit (typically starting at 0).
- For each $1 \leq i < n$, $a_i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, k_i-1\}$ indicates the position within the $U_{i-1}$ unit.
:::

We define operations on timepoints, such as addition and subtraction, to allow for temporal manipulation:

:::{.callout-note}
## Axiom 2: Temporal Addition

For timepoints $\tau = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ and $\tau' = (a'_0, a'_1, \ldots, a'_{n-1})$, the addition operation $\oplus$ is defined as:
$\tau \oplus \tau' = \mathrm{Normalize}((a_0 + a'_0, a_1 + a'_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} + a'_{n-1}))$
where $\mathrm{Normalize}$ applies the canonical representation procedure.
:::

These operations form the basis for temporal calculations in the framework.

## Visualization of Concepts

To better understand these abstract concepts, we can visualize how a timepoint is represented in the hierarchical structure:

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Visualization of a timepoint in the hierarchical temporal structure"
#| echo: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle

# Create a simple visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 4))

# Define the units and their subdivisions
units = ['Epoch', 'Cycle', 'Step', 'Microstep']
subdivisions = [24, 60, 1000]  # Each unit's subdivision factor

# Set up y-axis
y_positions = np.arange(len(units))
ax.set_yticks(y_positions)
ax.set_yticklabels(units)

# Set axis labels
ax.set_title('Timepoint (2, 15, 30, 500) in Hierarchical Structure')
ax.set_xlabel('Time')
ax.set_ylabel('Hierarchical Units')

# Draw hierarchical representation
# Example timepoint: (2, 15, 30, 500)
timepoint = [2, 15, 30, 500]

# Calculate absolute positions for visualization
total_width = timepoint[0] * subdivisions[0] * subdivisions[1] * subdivisions[2]
total_width += timepoint[1] * subdivisions[1] * subdivisions[2]
total_width += timepoint[2] * subdivisions[2]
total_width += timepoint[3]

# Normalize to 0-1 for visualization
normalized_width = 1.0
scale_factor = normalized_width / total_width

# Draw each level
current_pos = 0
for i, (unit, value) in enumerate(zip(units, timepoint)):
    # Calculate width for this unit's contribution
    if i == 0:
        width = value * subdivisions[0] * subdivisions[1] * subdivisions[2] * scale_factor
    elif i == 1:
        width = value * subdivisions[1] * subdivisions[2] * scale_factor
    elif i == 2:
        width = value * subdivisions[2] * scale_factor
    else:
        width = value * scale_factor
    
    # Draw rectangle
    if width > 0:
        rect = Rectangle((current_pos, i-0.4), width, 0.8, 
                         facecolor=['#e3f2fd', '#e8f5e9', '#fff3e0', '#f3e5f5'][i], 
                         alpha=0.7, edgecolor='blue')
        ax.add_patch(rect)
        # Add label
        ax.text(current_pos + width/2, i, f"{value}", va='center', ha='center', fontweight='bold')
    
    current_pos += width

# Add vertical line at the timepoint's position
ax.axvline(x=current_pos, color='red', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, label='Timepoint Position')

# Set axis limits and remove spines for cleaner look
ax.set_xlim(0, normalized_width * 1.1)
ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Mathematical Properties

The Timekeeper framework ensures several important mathematical properties:

1. **Order Preservation**: The lexicographical order on timepoints preserves the natural progression of time.
2. **Temporal Morphism Completeness**: The morphisms between agent time and human time form a bijection that preserves order and relative durations.
3. **Modular Sublattice**: The hierarchy of temporal partitions forms a modular sublattice of the partition lattice.

These properties ensure that the temporal system behaves intuitively and consistently.

## Implementation Implications

The mathematical foundation directly informs the implementation of the framework:

```python
class AgentTemporal:
    """
    Implementation of the temporal universe (Definition 1) and
    hierarchical partitions (Definition 2).
    """
    def __init__(self, unit_config=None):
        # Initialize with a hierarchy of time units
        # Each unit corresponds to a partition level
        self.default_config = [
            {"name": "epoch", "subdivisions": 24},   # Pi_0
            {"name": "cycle", "subdivisions": 60},   # Pi_1
            {"name": "step",  "subdivisions": 1000}, # Pi_2
            {"name": "microstep", "subdivisions": None, "is_base": True}  # Pi_3
        ]
        # ...
```

## Next Steps

With these core principles established, we can now explore:

1. [Task Scheduling](scheduling.qmd): How tasks are scheduled within this temporal framework
2. [Dynamic Adaptation](adaptation.qmd): How the system adapts to changing conditions
3. [System Architecture](architecture.qmd): How these concepts are organized into a cohesive system
