Timekeeper API Reference
========================

Welcome to the Timekeeper API documentation.

This reference provides details about the implementation of the Timekeeper framework,
cross-referenced with the formal mathematical theory it is based on.

Theoretical Foundation
-------------------

The implementation is based on a rigorous mathematical theory of temporal structures
and operations. Each component in the API is linked to its theoretical foundation,
providing traceability between theory and implementation.

For the complete theoretical foundation, see the :doc:`Theory Documentation <../../docs/theory/index>`.
