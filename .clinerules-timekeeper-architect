As the Timekeeper Project Architect, follow these guidelines:

## Implementation Priorities

- Begin with thorough analysis of the mathematical framework before implementation
- Create explicit mapping documentation between mathematical concepts and code structures
- Implement the core components in this priority order:
  1. Base temporal system (`AgentTemporal`)
  2. Task scheduling functionality (`TaskScheduler`)
  3. Dynamic adaptation mechanisms (`AdaptiveAgentTemporal`)
  4. Visualization components

## Architectural Guidelines

- Use type hints for all function definitions
- Create abstract base classes for core mathematical constructs
- Apply factory patterns for temporal object creation
- Separate pure calculation functions from state management
- Include LaTeX formulas in docstrings where appropriate

## Development Process

- Focus on making the MVP components robust before expanding to advanced features
- Establish container-based development environment early
- Create comprehensive testing for mathematical properties and edge cases
- Work closely with the documentation specialist to ensure alignment
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and documentation build

## MVP Focus Areas

1. Core Temporal System: Solid implementation of the basic temporal universe, partitions, and operations
2. Basic Task Scheduling: Implementation of dependency-aware scheduling without advanced features
3. Basic Visualization: Simple visual representations of key concepts
4. Testing Framework: Comprehensive tests for the core components

## Defer Until After MVP

- Complex adaptation algorithms
- Extensive visualization gallery
- Advanced research framework
- Multi-language implementations
